   - Highly virulent
   - High mortality
   - Requires BSL-4

3. **Reston ebolavirus**:
   - Less pathogenic to humans
   - May require BSL-4 or enhanced BSL-3
   - Check regulations

4. **Other Species**:
   - Bundibugyo, Tai Forest, Bombali
   - Check containment requirements

### Storage
- Liquid nitrogen storage
- -80°C storage
- Authorized facilities only

---

## Cell Culture Systems

### Vero E6 Cells
- African green monkey kidney cells
- Most commonly used
- Support Ebola replication well

### Huh-7 Cells
- Human hepatoma cells
- Good for research
- Support replication

### Primary Human Macrophages
- For research purposes
- More complex
- Research use

### Media Preparation
- MEM or DMEM with 10% FBS
- Maintenance: MEM or DMEM with 2% FBS
- Filter sterilize (0.22μm)

---

## Production Protocol

### Step 1: Cell Preparation

1. **Cell Culture**:
   - Grow Vero E6 cells to 80-90% confluency
   - Maintain in BSL-4 facility
   - Verify cell health

2. **Preparation**:
   - Prepare maintenance medium
   - Verify all equipment in BSL-4
   - Check life support systems

### Step 2: Virus Inoculation

1. **Preparation**:
   - Thaw virus stock
   - Work in Class III cabinet
   - Use appropriate MOI (0.01-0.1)

2. **Infection**:
   - Adsorb virus for 1 hour at 37°C
   - Remove inoculum
   - Add maintenance medium

### Step 3: Incubation

1. **Monitoring**:
   - Incubate at 37°C in CO2
   - Monitor for CPE
   - Check daily

2. **CPE Development**:
   - CPE typically appears 5-7 days
   - Monitor progression
   - Harvest when CPE is extensive

### Step 4: Virus Harvest

1. **Collection**:
   - Collect supernatant when CPE extensive
   - Clarify by low-speed centrifugation
   - Store at -80°C

2. **Processing**:
   - Work in Class III cabinet
   - Handle carefully
   - Store appropriately

### Step 5: Purification (Optional)

1. **Sucrose Gradient**:
   - Purify by gradient centrifugation
   - Collect virus band
   - Dialyze against buffer

2. **Titer Determination**:
   - Plaque assay
   - TCID50 assay
   - Determine virus titer

---

## Quality Control

### Titer Determination
- Plaque assay (BSL-4)
- TCID50 assay
- Verify titer

### Identity Confirmation
- RT-PCR for identity
- Electron microscopy for morphology
- Verify species/strain

### Sterility Testing
- Test for contamination
- Verify purity
- Must be performed in BSL-4

---

## Storage and Handling

### Storage Conditions
- Liquid nitrogen
- -80°C
- Authorized facilities only

### Stability
- Stable at -80°C for years
- Liquid nitrogen: Very stable

### Handling Precautions
- BSL-4 only
- Positive pressure suits
- Complete isolation
- Extensive decontamination
- All waste autoclaved

---

## Expected Yields

### Typical Yields
- **Virus titer**: 10^6-10^8 PFU/ml
