## Production Protocol

### Step 1: Strain Revival

1. **From Frozen Stock**:
   - Thaw frozen glycerol stock on ice
   - Work in biosafety cabinet
   - Streak onto TSA plate
   - Incubate at 37°C in CO2-enriched atmosphere (5-10% CO2) for 48-72 hours
   - **Exception**: B. suis and B. canis may not require CO2

2. **From Lyophilized**:
   - Reconstitute according to instructions
   - Streak onto TSA plate
   - Incubate at 37°C in CO2 for 48-72 hours

3. **Verification**:
   - Check colony morphology (small, smooth, translucent)
   - Gram stain (small gram-negative coccobacilli)
   - Catalase positive
   - Oxidase positive (most species)

### Step 2: Seed Culture Preparation

1. **Inoculation**:
   - Pick single colony from plate
   - Work in biosafety cabinet
   - Inoculate 5ml Brucella broth in tube
   - Incubate at 37°C in CO2 with shaking (200 rpm) for 24-48 hours

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Check for growth (slow-growing organism)
   - OD600 should reach 0.3-0.5
   - Verify no contamination

### Step 3: Production Culture

1. **Small-Scale Production**:
   - Transfer 1ml seed culture to 100ml Brucella broth
   - Use baffled flask
   - Incubate at 37°C in CO2 with shaking (200 rpm) for 48-72 hours

2. **Large-Scale Production**:
   - Scale up proportionally
   - Use large baffled flasks or fermenter
   - Maintain CO2 atmosphere (if required)
   - Monitor growth

3. **Harvest Time**:
   - Harvest during late log phase
   - Typically 48-72 hours
   - OD600 should be 0.8-1.2
   - Check for maximum cell density

### Step 4: Cell Harvest

1. **Centrifugation**:

   - Collect pellet (cells)
   - Discard supernatant (or process separately)

2. **Washing**:
