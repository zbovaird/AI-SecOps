## Production Protocol

### Step 1: Strain Revival

1. **From Frozen Stock**:
   - Thaw frozen glycerol stock on ice
   - Transfer to anaerobic chamber or use gas pack jar
   - Streak onto blood agar plate
   - Incubate anaerobically at 37°C for 24-48 hours

2. **From Cooked Meat Medium**:
   - Transfer small amount to fresh medium
   - Incubate anaerobically at 37°C for 24 hours

3. **Verification**:
   - Check colony morphology (double zone hemolysis on blood agar)
   - Gram stain (gram-positive rods)
   - Anaerobic growth requirement

### Step 2: Seed Culture Preparation

1. **Inoculation**:
   - Pick single colony from plate
   - Inoculate 10ml thioglycolate medium in anaerobic tube
   - Incubate anaerobically at 37°C for 18-24 hours

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Check for growth (turbidity)
   - Verify anaerobic conditions (resazurin should be colorless)
   - Check for contamination

### Step 3: Production Culture

1. **Small-Scale Production**:
   - Transfer 1ml seed culture to 100ml thioglycolate medium
   - Use anaerobic flask or jar
   - Incubate anaerobically at 37°C for 24-48 hours

2. **Large-Scale Production**:
   - Scale up proportionally
   - Use large anaerobic flasks or fermenter
   - Maintain strict anaerobic conditions
   - Monitor pH (should drop during growth)

3. **Harvest Time**:
   - Harvest during late log/early stationary phase
   - Typically 24-48 hours
   - Check for maximum toxin production

### Step 4: Toxin Extraction

1. **Centrifugation**:
   - Centrifuge culture at 10,000 x g for 20 minutes at 4°C
   - Collect supernatant (contains epsilon toxin)
   - Discard pellet (cells and spores)

2. **Filtration**:
   - Filter supernatant through 0.45μm membrane
   - Follow with 0.22μm filtration
   - Store at 4°C if proceeding immediately

3. **Concentration** (Optional):
   - Concentrate using ultrafiltration (10 kDa cutoff)
   - Or use ammonium sulfate precipitation (60% saturation)

### Step 5: Purification

#### Method A: Ion-Exchange Chromatography

1. **Column Preparation**:
   - Use DEAE-Sephadex or Q-Sepharose
   - Equilibrate with 20mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0

2. **Loading**:
   - Load filtered supernatant
   - Wash with equilibration buffer

3. **Elution**:
   - Elute with linear gradient: 0-0.5M NaCl
   - Epsilon toxin typically elutes around 0.2-0.3M NaCl
   - Collect fractions
   - Monitor at 280nm

#### Method B: Gel Filtration

1. **Column Preparation**:
   - Use Sephadex G-100 or Superdex 75
   - Equilibrate with phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)

2. **Separation**:
   - Load sample (after ion-exchange or concentration)
   - Elute with buffer
   - Epsilon toxin elutes as single peak (~33 kDa)
   - Collect fractions

#### Method C: Affinity Chromatography

1. **Column Preparation**:
   - Use anti-epsilon toxin antibody column (if available)
   - Or use receptor-based affinity column

2. **Purification**:
   - Load sample
   - Wash extensively
   - Elute with low pH buffer
   - Neutralize immediately

### Step 6: Dialysis and Concentration

1. **Dialysis**:
   - Dialyze against phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)
   - Change buffer 2-3 times
   - Remove salts

2. **Concentration**:
   - Concentrate using ultrafiltration
   - Or use lyophilization
   - Determine final concentration
