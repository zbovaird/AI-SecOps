# Bacillus anthracis: Culture and Spore Production Protocol

## Overview

**Agent Classification**: Category A Select Agent  
**Difficulty Level**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Difficult - Requires BSL-3, spore production complex)  
**Containment Required**: BSL-3 minimum (BSL-4 for virulent strains)  
**Registration**: CDC Select Agent Program registration required

Bacillus anthracis is a spore-forming, gram-positive bacterium that causes anthrax. The organism can exist in both vegetative and spore forms, with spores being highly resistant and stable in the environment.

## Strain Selection

### Attenuated Strains (BSL-3)

   - Reduced virulence
   - Used for research and vaccine production
   - Still requires BSL-3 containment

2. **Other Attenuated Strains**:
   - Various research strains available
   - Check attenuation characteristics
   - Verify containment requirements

### Wild-Type Virulent Strains (BSL-4)

1. **Fully Encapsulated Strains**:
   - Carry both pX01 and pX02 plasmids
   - Fully virulent
   - Requires BSL-4 containment
   - Used only in authorized biodefense research

### Strain Storage
- **Short-term**: Agar slants at 4°C
- **Long-term**: -80°C glycerol stocks
- **Spores**: Long-term storage at 4°C or room temperature

## Production Protocol

### Part A: Vegetative Cell Production

#### Step 1: Strain Revival

1. **From Frozen Stock**:
   - Thaw frozen glycerol stock on ice
   - Work in biosafety cabinet
   - Streak onto BHI agar plate
   - Incubate at 37°C in CO2-enriched atmosphere (5% CO2) for 18-24 hours

2. **From Spore Stock**:
   - Heat-shock spores at 65°C for 30 minutes
   - Streak onto BHI agar
   - Incubate at 37°C in CO2 for 18-24 hours

3. **Verification**:
   - Check colony morphology (non-hemolytic, rough)
   - Gram stain (gram-positive rods, chains)
   - Verify no contamination

#### Step 2: Seed Culture

1. **Inoculation**:
   - Pick single colony
   - Inoculate 5ml BHI broth
   - Incubate at 37°C with shaking (200 rpm) for 6-8 hours

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Check OD600 (target: 0.5-0.8)
   - Verify growth

#### Step 3: Production Culture

1. **Scale-Up**:
   - Transfer 1ml seed to 100ml BHI broth
   - Use baffled flask
   - Incubate at 37°C with shaking (200 rpm) for 12-16 hours

2. **Harvest**:
   - Harvest during late log phase
   - OD600 should be 0.8-1.2
   - Use for spore production or other purposes

### Part B: Spore Production

#### Step 1: Inoculation

1. **Preparation**:
   - Use vegetative cells from production culture
   - Or use spore production medium plates

2. **Plate Method**:
   - Spread vegetative cells on spore production medium plates
   - Incubate at 37°C for 48-72 hours
   - Transfer to 30°C
   - Continue incubation for 7-10 days

#### Step 2: Spore Formation

1. **Monitoring**:
   - Check sporulation by phase-contrast microscopy
   - Spores appear as bright, refractive bodies
   - Monitor daily
   - Harvest when >95% sporulation achieved

2. **Timing**:
   - Typically 7-10 days total
   - May vary by strain
   - Check regularly

#### Step 3: Spore Harvest

1. **Collection**:
   - Scrape spores from plates with sterile saline
   - Or harvest from liquid culture
   - Work in biosafety cabinet

2. **Washing**:
   - Wash 3x with sterile distilled water
   - Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes
   - Resuspend in sterile saline

#### Step 4: Spore Purification

   - Kills vegetative cells
   - Spores survive

2. **Washing**:
   - Wash again with sterile water
   - Centrifuge
   - Resuspend in sterile saline

3. **Storage**:
   - Store at 4°C (short-term)
   - Or lyophilize for long-term storage

## Quality Control

### Spore Verification

1. **Microscopy**:
   - Phase-contrast microscopy
   - Spores appear bright and refractive
   - Count sporulation percentage

2. **Heat Resistance**:

3. **Viability**:
   - Plate serial dilutions
   - Count colonies
   - Calculate spore concentration

### Purity Assessment

1. **Gram Stain**:
   - Check for vegetative cells
   - Should be mostly spores

2. **Contamination Check**:
   - Plate on selective media
   - Check for other bacteria

### Identity Confirmation

1. **PCR**:
   - Species-specific PCR
   - Verify strain characteristics

2. **Biochemical Tests**:
   - Verify B. anthracis characteristics
   - Check for capsule (if applicable)
