   - Gram stain (small, pleomorphic gram-negative coccobacilli)
   - Catalase positive
   - Oxidase negative
   - Slow-growing organism

### Step 2: Seed Culture Preparation

1. **Inoculation**:
   - Pick single colony from plate

   - Incubate at 37°C in CO2 with shaking (200 rpm) for 24-48 hours

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Check for growth (slow-growing)
   - OD600 should reach 0.3-0.5
   - Verify no contamination
   - May take 48-72 hours for visible growth

### Step 3: Production Culture

1. **Small-Scale Production**:
   - Transfer 1ml seed culture to 100ml Cysteine Heart Broth
