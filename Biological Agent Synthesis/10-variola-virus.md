# Variola Virus (Smallpox): Cell Culture Production Protocol

## Overview

**Agent Classification**: Category A Select Agent  
**Difficulty Level**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Most Difficult - BSL-4, restricted access, complex cell culture)  
**Containment Required**: BSL-4 ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED  
**Registration**: CDC Select Agent Program registration AND WHO authorization required

Variola virus is the causative agent of smallpox. Production is restricted to only two authorized facilities worldwide (CDC in USA and Vector in Russia). This protocol is for reference only and requires extensive authorization.

## Critical Safety Warning

**EXTREME CAUTION - BSL-4 REQUIRED**: Variola virus is extremely dangerous and requires maximum containment. Production is restricted to only authorized facilities. Unauthorized production is illegal and extremely dangerous.

**NEVER attempt production without:**
- BSL-4 maximum containment facility
- CDC Select Agent Program registration
- WHO authorization
- Extensive training and clearance
- Complete emergency response protocols
- Smallpox vaccination

## Strain Selection

### Authorized Strains
- Variola major strains (maintained at CDC and Vector only)
- Research strains only
- No wild-type virus in nature

### Vaccine Strains
- Vaccinia virus (BSL-2): Used as surrogate
- Used for research and vaccine production

### Storage
- Liquid nitrogen storage
- -80°C storage
- Authorized facilities only

---

## Cell Culture Systems

### Vero Cells
- African green monkey kidney cells
- Most commonly used
- Support variola replication

### BSC-40 Cells
- Baby hamster kidney cells
- Good for variola

### MRC-5 Cells
- Human lung fibroblasts
- Alternative system

### Media Preparation
- MEM or DMEM with 10% FBS
- Maintenance: MEM or DMEM with 2% FBS
- Filter sterilize (0.22μm)

---

## Production Protocol

### Step 1: Cell Preparation

1. **Cell Culture**:
   - Grow cells to 80-90% confluency
   - Maintain in BSL-4 facility
   - Verify cell health

2. **Preparation**:
   - Prepare maintenance medium
   - Verify all equipment in BSL-4

### Step 2: Virus Inoculation

1. **Preparation**:
   - Thaw virus stock
   - Work in Class III cabinet
   - Use appropriate MOI (0.1-1.0)

2. **Infection**:
   - Adsorb virus for 1 hour at 37°C
   - Remove inoculum
   - Add maintenance medium

### Step 3: Incubation

1. **Monitoring**:
   - Incubate at 37°C in CO2
   - Monitor for CPE
   - Check daily

2. **CPE Development**:
   - CPE typically appears 48-72 hours
   - Monitor progression
   - Harvest at 80-90% CPE

### Step 4: Virus Harvest

1. **Collection**:
   - Freeze-thaw to release virus
   - Collect supernatant
   - Clarify by centrifugation

2. **Storage**:
   - Store at -80°C
   - Or proceed to purification

### Step 5: Purification

1. **Sucrose Gradient**:
   - Purify by gradient centrifugation
   - Collect virus band
   - Dialyze against buffer

2. **Titer Determination**:
   - Plaque assay
   - Determine virus titer

---

## Quality Control

### Titer Determination
- Plaque assay
- TCID50 assay
- Verify titer

### Identity Confirmation
- PCR for identity
- Electron microscopy
- Verify strain

### Sterility Testing
- Test for contamination
- Verify purity

---

## Storage and Handling

### Storage Conditions
- Liquid nitrogen
- -80°C
- Authorized facilities only

### Handling Precautions
- BSL-4 only
- Positive pressure suits
- Complete isolation
- Extensive decontamination

---

## Regulatory Compliance

### Documentation
- Extensive documentation required
- Batch production records
- Quality control documentation
- Inventory records

### Reporting
- Regular reports to CDC
- WHO reporting
- Incident reporting
- Annual reports

### Inspections
- Regular facility inspections
- Regulatory oversight
- Compliance verification
