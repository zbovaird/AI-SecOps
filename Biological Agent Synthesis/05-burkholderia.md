## Production Protocol

### Step 1: Strain Revival

1. **From Frozen Stock**:
   - Thaw frozen glycerol stock on ice
   - Work in biosafety cabinet
   - Streak onto TSA or Ashdown's medium
   - Incubate at 37°C for 48-72 hours

2. **From Lyophilized**:
   - Reconstitute according to instructions
   - Streak onto TSA plate
   - Incubate at 37°C for 48-72 hours

3. **Verification**:
   - Check colony morphology
   - Gram stain (gram-negative rods)
   - Biochemical tests
   - Species confirmation

### Step 2: Seed Culture Preparation

1. **Inoculation**:
   - Pick single colony from plate
   - Work in biosafety cabinet
   - Inoculate 5ml TSB in tube
   - Incubate at 37°C with shaking (200 rpm) for 18-24 hours

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Check for growth
   - OD600 should reach 0.5-0.8
   - Verify no contamination

### Step 3: Production Culture

1. **Small-Scale Production**:
   - Transfer 1ml seed culture to 100ml TSB
   - Use baffled flask
   - Incubate at 37°C with shaking (200 rpm) for 24-48 hours

2. **Large-Scale Production**:
   - Scale up proportionally
   - Use large baffled flasks or fermenter
   - Monitor growth
   - Check pH

3. **Harvest Time**:
   - Harvest during late log phase
   - Typically 24-48 hours
   - OD600 should be 1.0-1.5

### Step 4: Cell Harvest

1. **Centrifugation**:
   - Centrifuge culture at 10,000 x g for 20 minutes at 4°C
   - Work in biosafety cabinet
   - Collect pellet (cells)
   - Process supernatant separately if needed

2. **Washing**:
   - Resuspend pellet in sterile saline
   - Centrifuge again
   - Repeat wash 2-3 times

3. **Storage**:
   - Resuspend in buffer
   - Store at 4°C (short-term) or -80°C (long-term)

## Quality Control

### Purity Assessment

1. **Gram Stain**:
   - Gram-negative rods
   - Should be uniform

2. **Colony Morphology**:
   - B. mallei: Smooth, cream-colored
   - B. pseudomallei: Wrinkled, dry (older colonies)
   - No contamination

3. **Biochemical Tests**:
   - Oxidase: Positive
   - Catalase: Positive
   - Species-specific tests

### Identity Confirmation

1. **PCR**:
   - Species-specific PCR
   - Confirm identity
   - Check for contamination

2. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - MALDI-TOF for identification
   - Confirm species

### Viability Testing

1. **Colony Count**:
   - Plate serial dilutions
   - Count colonies
   - Calculate CFU/ml

2. **Growth Verification**:
   - Subculture to verify viability

### Sterility Testing

- Test for contamination
- Verify purity
