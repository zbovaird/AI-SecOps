   - **Incubate at 28°C** with shaking (200 rpm) for 24-48 hours
   - **Note**: 28°C for virulence studies, 37°C for rapid growth

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Check for growth
   - OD600 should reach 0.5-0.8
   - Verify no contamination
   - Check for characteristic growth pattern

### Step 3: Production Culture

1. **Small-Scale Production**:

   - **Incubate at 28°C** with shaking (200 rpm) for 24-48 hours
   - **Note**: Temperature choice depends on purpose:
     - 28°C: For virulence factor expression (F1 antigen, etc.)
     - 37°C: For rapid growth (reduced virulence expression)

2. **Large-Scale Production**:
   - Scale up proportionally
   - Use large baffled flasks or fermenter
   - Maintain appropriate temperature
