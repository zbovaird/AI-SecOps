2. **From Cooked Meat Medium**:
   - Transfer to fresh medium
   - Incubate anaerobically at 35°C for 24 hours

3. **Verification**:
   - Check colony morphology
   - Gram stain (gram-positive rods)
   - Verify anaerobic growth

#### Step 2: Seed Culture

1. **Inoculation**:
   - Pick single colony
