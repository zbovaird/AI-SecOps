## Production Protocol

### Step 1: Strain Revival

1. **From Frozen Stock**:
   - Thaw frozen glycerol stock on ice
   - Streak onto TSA plate
   - Incubate at 37°C for 18-24 hours

2. **From Lyophilized**:
   - Reconstitute according to manufacturer instructions
   - Streak onto TSA plate
   - Incubate at 37°C for 18-24 hours

3. **Verification**:
   - Check colony morphology (golden yellow, typical S. aureus)
   - Gram stain (gram-positive cocci in clusters)
   - Catalase test (positive)

### Step 2: Seed Culture Preparation

1. **Inoculation**:
   - Pick single colony from plate
   - Inoculate 5ml TSB in test tube
   - Incubate at 37°C with shaking (200 rpm) for 6-8 hours

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Check for turbidity
   - OD600 should reach 0.5-0.8
   - Verify no contamination

### Step 3: Production Culture

1. **Scale-Up**:
   - Transfer 1ml seed culture to 100ml TSB in 500ml flask
   - Incubate at 37°C with shaking (200 rpm) for 18-24 hours

2. **Large-Scale Production**:
   - For larger volumes, scale up proportionally
   - Use baffled flasks for better aeration
   - Monitor pH (should drop to 6.5-7.0)

3. **Harvest Time**:
   - Harvest during late log/early stationary phase
   - Typically 18-24 hours
   - Check OD600 (should be 1.5-2.5)

### Step 4: Toxin Extraction

1. **Centrifugation**:
   - Centrifuge culture at 10,000 x g for 20 minutes at 4°C
   - Collect supernatant (contains SEB)
   - Discard pellet (cells)

2. **Filtration**:
   - Filter supernatant through 0.45μm membrane
   - Follow with 0.22μm filtration for sterility
   - Store at 4°C if proceeding immediately

3. **Concentration** (Optional):
   - Concentrate using ultrafiltration (10 kDa cutoff)
   - Or use ammonium sulfate precipitation (60% saturation)

### Step 5: Purification

#### Method A: Ion-Exchange Chromatography

1. **Column Preparation**:
   - Use DEAE-Sephadex or Q-Sepharose
   - Equilibrate with 20mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0

2. **Loading**:
   - Load filtered supernatant or concentrated sample
   - Wash with equilibration buffer

3. **Elution**:
   - Elute with linear gradient: 0-0.5M NaCl
   - SEB typically elutes around 0.2-0.3M NaCl
   - Collect fractions
   - Monitor at 280nm

#### Method B: Gel Filtration

1. **Column Preparation**:
   - Use Sephadex G-75 or G-100
   - Equilibrate with phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)

2. **Separation**:
   - Load sample (after ion-exchange or concentration)
   - Elute with buffer
   - SEB elutes as single peak (~28 kDa)
   - Collect fractions

#### Method C: Affinity Chromatography

1. **Column Preparation**:
   - Use anti-SEB antibody column (if available)
   - Or use immobilized receptor column

2. **Purification**:
   - Load sample
   - Wash extensively
   - Elute with low pH buffer or chaotropic agent
   - Neutralize immediately

### Step 6: Dialysis and Concentration

1. **Dialysis**:
   - Dialyze against phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)
   - Change buffer 2-3 times
   - Remove salts and low molecular weight contaminants

2. **Concentration**:
   - Concentrate using ultrafiltration
   - Or use lyophilization
   - Determine final concentration

   - Should appear as single band (>95% pure)
   - Check for degradation products

2. **UV Spectroscopy**:
   - Measure A280
   - Calculate concentration using ε280 = 3.2 x 10^4 M^-1 cm^-1
   - Check A260/A280 ratio (should be ~0.6)

### Activity Assays

1. **ELISA**:
   - Use commercial SEB ELISA kit
   - Quantify toxin concentration
   - Compare to standard

2. **T-Cell Activation Assay**:

2. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - Confirm molecular weight (~28,366 Da)
   - Identify peptide fragments

### Sterility Testing

- Test for bacterial contamination
- Test for fungal contamination
- Filter through 0.22μm if needed
