## Extraction Protocol

### Step 1: Bean Preparation

   - Grind castor beans to fine powder using dedicated grinder
   - Use fume hood to minimize aerosol generation
   - Collect powder in sealed container

3. **Defatting**:
   - Add hexane or petroleum ether (3:1 ratio, solvent:meal)
   - Stir for 2-4 hours at room temperature
   - Filter through Whatman paper or centrifuge
   - Repeat defatting once more
   - Allow defatted meal to air dry completely
   - Store defatted meal in sealed container

**Yield**: Approximately 30-40% of original bean weight

### Step 2: Extraction

1. **Preparation**:
   - Weigh defatted meal (typically 100-500g)
   - Prepare 5% acetic acid solution (pH ~4.0)

2. **Extraction Process**:
   - Add acetic acid solution (10:1 ratio, solution:meal)
   - Stir continuously for 2-4 hours at room temperature
   - Maintain pH around 4.0 (adjust with acetic acid if needed)
   - Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 20 minutes
   - Collect supernatant (contains ricin)
   - Repeat extraction on pellet once more
   - Combine supernatants

3. **pH Adjustment**:
   - Adjust pH to 7.0-7.4 using NaOH solution
   - Filter through 0.45μm membrane
   - Store at 4°C if proceeding immediately

**Expected Yield**: 0.1-0.5% of defatted meal weight

### Step 3: Precipitation

1. **Ammonium Sulfate Precipitation**:
   - Add solid ammonium sulfate gradually to 60% saturation
   - Stir continuously until dissolved
   - Allow to stand for 2-4 hours at 4°C
   - Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 20 minutes
   - Collect precipitate

2. **Redissolution**:
   - Redissolve precipitate in minimal volume of phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)
   - Dialyze against phosphate buffer overnight
   - Change dialysis buffer 2-3 times

### Step 4: Purification

#### Method A: Ion-Exchange Chromatography

1. **Column Preparation**:
   - Equilibrate CM-Sephadex or CM-Cellulose column
   - Use phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)

2. **Loading**:
   - Load dialyzed sample
   - Wash with phosphate buffer until baseline

3. **Elution**:
   - Elute with gradient: 0-0.5M NaCl in phosphate buffer
   - Collect fractions
   - Monitor at 280nm

4. **Pooling**:
   - Pool ricin-containing fractions (typically elutes around 0.2-0.3M NaCl)
   - Concentrate if needed

#### Method B: Affinity Chromatography

1. **Column Preparation**:
   - Use galactose-immobilized resin (e.g., agarose-galactose)
   - Equilibrate with phosphate buffer

2. **Loading**:
   - Load sample
   - Wash extensively with buffer

3. **Elution**:

2. **Separation**:
   - Load sample (typically after ion-exchange)
   - Elute with phosphate buffer
   - Collect fractions
   - Ricin elutes as major peak

## Quality Control

### Purity Assessment

1. **SDS-PAGE**:
   - Run on 12% polyacrylamide gel
   - Ricin consists of two chains:
     - A chain: ~32 kDa
     - B chain: ~34 kDa
   - Purity should be >95%

2. **UV Spectroscopy**:
   - Measure A280
   - Calculate concentration using extinction coefficient (ε280 = 1.2 x 10^5 M^-1 cm^-1)
   - Check for contaminants (should have single peak)

### Activity Assays

1. **Hemagglutination Assay**:
   - Test ricin's ability to agglutinate red blood cells
   - Positive control: Known ricin preparation
   - Negative control: Buffer only

2. **Cell Cytotoxicity Assay**:
   - Test on cell lines (e.g., Vero cells)
   - Measure cell viability after exposure
   - Compare to standard ricin preparation

3. **Ribosome Inactivation Assay**:
   - Test ability to inhibit protein synthesis
   - Use cell-free translation system
   - Measure inhibition compared to control

### Identity Confirmation

1. **Western Blot**:
   - Use anti-ricin antibodies
   - Confirm presence of A and B chains

2. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - Confirm molecular weight
   - Identify peptide fragments

### Sterility Testing

- Test for bacterial contamination
- Test for fungal contamination
- If contaminated, filter through 0.22μm membrane
